# Databases & Data Structures that power them

## Introduction

- LSM Databases

## Disk Storage & SS Tables

- explain what they are at high level
- explain the block structure


## Memtables & Balanced Treaps

- data is stored in memory and eventually flushed to disk
- the tree should be balanced
- if the user is inserting many a lot of data once per time, we will get a skewed tree
- we want the tree to be balanced!
- introduce some randomaization

## Reading Data & Bloom Filters

## Compaction & Priority Queues

- outline of SS Tables and LMS trees
  - LSM trees
    - on disk represepntation
  - SSTables

- build up memtable
  - balanced tree
    - treap
    - b tree
  - flushing 
    - it when gets big enough
    - switch
    - steps
      - build up pages
      - compress page
      - append to disk
      - update page offset file (index)
